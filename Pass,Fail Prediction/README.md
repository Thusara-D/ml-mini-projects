# Pass / Fail Prediction

This mini project predicts whether a student will **Pass** or **Fail** an exam using a simple machine learning classification model.

---

## Objective

To understand and practice the basic machine learning workflow for **classification problems**, including:

- Data preparation
- Feature selection
- Model training
- Binary prediction (Yes / No)
- Probability-based output

---

## Problem Statement

Given a student’s:
- Study hours
- Attendance percentage

The model predicts whether the student is likely to **Pass** or **Fail** the exam.

---

## Tools Used

- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn

---

## Machine Learning Model

- **Algorithm**: Logistic Regression  
- **Type**: Supervised Learning (Classification)
